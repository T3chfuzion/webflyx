This is a test file to see if the hexadecimal representation works correctly.
We need enough lines to ensure the output has required address lines.
Let's add a few more lines just to be certain.
Hexadecimal viewing with xxd command can be fun!
Adding another line to make sure we hit the necessary byte count.
Still not enough? Add more lines if this isn't sufficient.
Almost there? Maybe one or two more lines.
